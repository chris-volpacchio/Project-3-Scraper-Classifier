    "#### The following code demonstrates the development and refinement of a binary text classifier designed to read and ingest data from two sub-reddit threads of popular television programs. I will be using the Pushshift api to navigate throughout Reddit.com and the two forementioned sub-reddits. The penultimate is to establish a classifier that will group posts by identifying key terms associated with each topic and then looking for them in the text. Our final step is to have a classifier that is ready to be tested and strengthened through user feedback.\n",

    "#### Type 2 errors are the main source of our concern when we are trying to identify TV–MA content. A Type 2 error is also known as a  'false–negative' which in this case would mean that we predicted a the program content was *not* TV–MA rated though in actuality it was. Realizing this error type would be especially bad in this scenario because it would mean that we had flagged explicit content as safe for children of ages 5 and below to be watching. We would *much* rather prevent children from seeing program content that is not TV–MA (but we classify as such) than accidently showing them the oppossite. Thankfully through refinement of our model we can see that ~ 97% of TV–MA content is being properly identified. This number is referred to as our <u>True Positive Rate</u> and shows us the rate at which our model is finding unwanted content. Conversely, this would mean that ~ 3% of the time we are allowing some TV–MA content to pass through to a child viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This measurement displays the TV content can be especially jarring for children who are accustom to a certain brand of television and are highly attentive and impressionable when watching. We must keep in mind that television whether streamed through a cable box or through internet is still a popular medium for entertainment. Condisering that the first 5 years of a child's life contribute to ~ 90% of their brain development we want to limit harmful intake as much as possible\n",

In particular, an advanced boosting method known as XGBoost as well as pipelining will increase the number of models that our data will pass through and hopefully decrease our model variance.\n",
