"90% of a child's brain is developed by age 5."

Help distinguish between TV-Y (Arthur) and TV-MA (Attack On Titan!) for parents who are trying to limit theeir children's exposure to violence. The waters of TV ratings have been a topic of debate since the establishment of the FCC. Animated series in particular have been a popular topic for discussion as they are highly impressionable on children. Television still remains to be one of the most popular mediums for youth entertainment {inserts streaming stats} {Maybe to do with Netflix "Children's" streaming preferences}.

One deals with more complex topics like highâ€“pressure interpersonal conflict and death.

# Problem Statement

<em>TV program content ratings have been a topic of debate since the establishment of the FCC. Animated series in particular have been a recurring topic for discussion due to the subject matter falling on the line between fantasy and reality. Animated programs in particular tend to be geared toward younger audiences who can intake hundreds of hours of television by the time that their brain is 90% developed (typically seen by age 5). Due to the impressionable nature of children coupled with the abundance of program options children have access to it is as important as it ever has been to ensure that content served is age-appropriate.</em>

## Executive Summary

Through thorough analysis of the SAT & ACT data as well as independent research, I have concluded that the most effective way to increase participation rate for the SAT is to lobby local governments for its mandate and funding.

# Conclusion

### Recommendations
SAT put in more resources into some states than it did for others; whether that be money given or partnership with state legislature through lobbying to make the exam mandatory. We 
can see some effects of those efforts in not only the SAT PR increases but in the ACT PR decreases as well. Scores
are correlated with taking another exam meaning if one student does well on one exam in same year they may take other
as well. This is showing that prep for an SAT course spread out by CB itsself could be useful as those who take both
exams are likely very interested in 'superscoring' and obtaining the best grade possible. If this is in fact the case 
having official prep resources, whether that be books or courses, by CB could influence those students to do well as well. on the other hand, there is a fairly strong negative correlatioin with test results on SAT and participation in the next year meaning that those who dont do very well are going to want to take it again. This further proves our previous point of students really wanting to max out their exams. As a business it may be more lucrative to have students be taking exam multiple times and maybe it makes more ssense to invest more resources into exam availability and presence over the actual prep itself. I reccommend to follow down same path of partnering with states to have exam be mandatory but not before modeling out revenue from taking exams and how long it would take to see profit based on deal that is determined with funds allocated (i.e. Illinois 3yr 14.3 mill mandatory agreement). This seemed to work well in terms of increasing participation but the amount of participants over rate multiplied by what their tests are bringing in is what will help optimize the CB business.
